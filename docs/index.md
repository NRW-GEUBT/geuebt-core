# Welcome to the documentation of Geübt-Validate

This is the Core module of NRW-GEÜBT.

Users provided metadata and assemblies are processed with the BfR pipelines 
chewie-snake and bakcharak to identify clusters and characterize isolates.
Results and MEtadata are saved in a local MongoDB database.
Data for the new assemblies are saved to the database and cluster information is updated.
